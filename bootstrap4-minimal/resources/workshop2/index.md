<hr/>
 <p>Coastal ecosystems are changing due to climate change, pollution, and overfishing. California's fisheries, coastal tourism and recreation, and overall coastal community health depends on the wellbeing of marine ecosystems. While physical measurements, such as temperature, salinity, and oxygen, can be readily measured, there is not a comprehensive network to understand how marine life is responding to these changes. Urgently needed are cheaper, faster, and higher-quality ways to collect time-series data with broad spatial coverage that captures changes in marine ecosystems from plankton to whales. </p>

<p>
This workshop will explore various technologies to enhance the monitoring of key species to provide insight into ecosystem health. The focus will include looking at technology that can fill in knowledge gaps under 3 key health indices: biodiversity, animal migration, and ecosystem function. We will also explore and refine tying together social and ecological indicators.

<h3> Breakout Groups </h3>
<p> The majority of the workshop will be spent in breakout groups exploring various questions:</p>
<p> *Exact questions are subject to change* </p>

<p><b> Technology </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) What technologies can monitor ecosystem health (via indicator species and ocean variables) that informs on: biodiversity, species migration, and ecosystem function? </p>
<p> &emsp; b) What technologies have the lowest barriers to widespread deployment? </p>

<p><b> Data </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) How do we integrate data that already exists? </p>
<p> &emsp; b) What human-use data streams can be integrated? </p>

<p><b> Research </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) What new knowledge or research directions can be filled by this monitoring network? </p>
<p> &emsp; b) What information would be most desirable from an ecosystem modeling perspective? </p>

<p><b> Outreach </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) What technologies support community science initiatives? </p>
<p> &emsp; b) What other partnerships or collaborations would support this work and how? </p>

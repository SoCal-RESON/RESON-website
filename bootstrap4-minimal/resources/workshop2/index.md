<h1>Workshop 2: Coming January 2022</h1>

<div id="main-container">

         <blockquote>
            <p class="lead">RESON will be building off of the first workshop where various coastal groups were brought together to determine their ecosystem monitoring needs and help articulate the societal need for RESON. Now with a better understanding of the societal needs of RESON, we will explore the technological possibilities to enhance biological monitoring. This next workshop will explore what new or underused technologies could provide higher spatial and temporal sampling of data. The focus will include looking at technology that can fill in knowledge gaps under 3 key domains: biodiversity, animal migration, and ecosystem function. </p>

<h2>Workshop 2: Exploring Technologies to Monitor Coastal Ecosystem Health in California</h2>
<div id="main-container">

         <blockquote>
            <p class="lead">ESON hosted a 2-day virtual workshop to bring together a diverse network of people who are invested in the long-term health of California's coastal ecosystem. About 57 participants joined to identify sensors that are the most capable of measuring abundance, diversity, and vital signs in representative organisms in 5 functional groups (listed below), which are indicators for biodiversity, migration, and ecosystem function.  Find the workshop report, opening remarks video, and collaborations below. <br/> </p>

<hr/>
 <p>Coastal ecosystems are changing due to climate change, pollution, and overfishing. California's fisheries, coastal tourism and recreation, and overall coastal community health depends on the wellbeing of marine ecosystems. While physical measurements, such as temperature, salinity, and oxygen, can be readily measured, there is not a comprehensive network to understand how marine life is responding to these changes. Urgently needed are cheaper, faster, and higher-quality ways to collect time-series data with broad spatial coverage that captures changes in marine ecosystems from plankton to whales. </p>

<p>
This workshop will explore various technologies to enhance the monitoring of key species to provide insight into ecosystem health. The focus will include looking at technology that can fill in knowledge gaps under 3 key health indices: biodiversity, animal migration, and ecosystem function. We will also explore and refine tying together social and ecological indicators.

 <p><b> Seeking Student Helpers| </b> We are looking for student helpers for this workshop. Please find all relevant information, including the application, in this <a href="{{site.baseurl }}/news/student_w2_participation.pdf"> flyer. </a> Applications are due on Wednesday, January 19, 2022.

<h3> Breakout Groups </h3>
<p> The majority of the workshop will be spent in breakout groups exploring various questions:</p>
<p> *Exact questions are subject to change* </p>

<p><b> Technology </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) What sensors are the most capable of measuring abundance, diversity, and vitals signs in representative organisms in these functional groups </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<u>Ecosystem functional groups:</u></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Primary producers (phytoplankton, kelp) </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Benthic primary consumers (sea urchins, abalone) </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Pelagic primary consumers (sardines, anchovies, squid) </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Nearshore predators (kelp forest fish, sharks, seals)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Pelagic predators (tuna, sharks, fish)</p>

<p> &emsp; b) Do these sensors have real-time monitoring? Can it be easily and widely deployed? What's the potential cost?</p>

<p><b> Data </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) How do you make individual physiological and population-level measurements that are widely interoperable across modeling and observation-based prediction frameworks? </p>
<p> &emsp; b) Are there measures of human activity that are proxies for reliance on marine ecosystem services? </p>

<p><b> Convergent science </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) What technologies from yesterdayâ€™s conversations best support community science initiatives? </p>
<p> &emsp; b) How can we co-create data streams that are beneficial to user communities and quantifying the state of the ecosystem?  </p>

<p><b> Identifying Next Steps </b></p>
<p> &emsp; a) What are the best ways forward to deploy this network?</p>

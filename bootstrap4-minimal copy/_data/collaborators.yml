- name: "Plumes and Blooms Project"
  acronym: "PnB"
  description: 'A NASA-funded study at UCSB investigating marine plankton blooms associated with runoff since 1996. The goal of this project is to develop new satellite ocean color algorithms for 
  coastal waters influenced by terrigenous materials (sediments, dissolved organic materials, etc.). In situ optical quantities and in-water constituents are collected on a 7-station 
  transect across the Santa Barbara Channel and then related to simultaneous ocean color imagery.'
